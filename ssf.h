 * MiniSSF is a streamlined implementation of the Scalable Simulation
 * Framework (SSF) that supports large-scale parallel discrete-event
 * simulation. MiniSSF implements a subset of the SSF API and modifies
 * it whenever necessary for greater usability. MiniSSF uses the
 * minimalistic design principle and as such features only a small
 * number of functions and classes for users to conveniently construct
 * large-scale discrete-event simulation models. MiniSSF supports
 * emulation by throttling the simulation time in relation to the
 * wall-clock time. MiniSSF also supports portable simulation on most
 * common parallel platforms.
