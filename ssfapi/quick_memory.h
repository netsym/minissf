/**
 * \file quick_memory.h
 * \brief Header file for quick memory management.
 *
 * Quick memory is a memory management layer that provides fast memory
 * allocation and deallocation services at each processor. The speed
 * comes at the cost of additional memory consumption due to
 * fragmentation. The memory blocks are chosen from free memory chunks
 * with sizes rounded up to the power of two.
 *
 * The header file also contains the definition of the QuickObject
 * class; Users do not need to include this header file directly; it
 * is included from ssf.h.
