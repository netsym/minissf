   * Entities are static objects. That is, the user can only create
   * entities at the simulation init phase (before ssf_start() is
   * called or within Entity::init() methods). Once created, the
   * entities should never be reclaimed by the user. Instead, they are
   * reclaimed by the simulator after we finish the simulation (after
   * ssf_finalize() is called).
   *
   * When an entity is created, it is independent. That is, it
   * maintains its own timeline, with its own simulation clock that
   * advances independently from other timelines, unless the user
   * align the entity to another entity, in which case the coaligned
   * entities shares the same timeline and the same simulation
   * clock. Since coaligned entities are time synchronized, they can
   * directly access each other's state variables, processes,
   * inchannels and outchannels.
   *
   * We added an extension to this entity constructor for real-time
   * simulation: the user can make this entity an "emulated" entity,
   * which means that events associated with this entity will be
   * 'pinned down' to real time; for an entity that does not handle
   * emulation events, nor does it care about real time issues, this
   * flag should be false (as the default). 
   *
   * Also, if the entity is accepting events from external systems,
   * the user usually needs to specify the "responsiveness" of the
   * entity, which is defined to be the maximum delay allowed for the
   * entity to respond to the arrival of an external event.
