/** \brief Semaphores used for synchronizing processes with an entity.
 *
 * It is frequently the case that an SSF process needs to signal
 * another process about its progress without passing data. Normally,
 * this can be achieved by using two channels: one outchannel and one
 * inchannel. The channels are mapped together and events are sent as
 * the signal from one process to the other. This situation becomes
 * more complicated when there are more processes involved. The
 * semaphores can be used here to ease this situation. A semaphore
 * must be an entity state (that is, it's a member variable of the
 * user-defined entity class). Processes belonging to the same entity
 * can operate on this semaphore in a way similar to an operating
 * system semaphore for inter-process communications (such as in the
 * typical producer-consumer scenario).
