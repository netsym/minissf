   * This method can only be called within a procedure of a

   * the inchannel: when the process unblocks and returns from the
   * wait statement, it should use this method to get the arrived
   * event immediately. An event arrived at the inchannel will not be
   * stored; it must be retrieved using this method or it will be
   * discarded implicitly by the system afterwards. Also, a newly
   * arrived event can be retrieved at most once by any waiting
   * process. Once it has been retrieved, when calling this method
   * again, the method will throw an exeception and return null. If
   * multiple processes are waiting on the same inchannel, each
   * waiting process can retrieve a copy of the arrived event. If
   * multiple events arrive at the inchannel simultaneously, each
   * event arrival will be treated separately. That is, if the process
   * waits on the inchannel in a loop, each iteration will handle only
   * one arrival event.
