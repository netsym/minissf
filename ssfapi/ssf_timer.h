 * A timer encapsulates a callback function, which can either be a
 * member function of an entity class, a regular function with a
 * designated signature, or the callback() method of this class. A
 * timer must be owned by an entity (i.e., a timer is treated as a
 * state of an entity).  The timer can be scheduled to fire off at a
 * future simulation time. It can also be cancelled if necessary
 * before it goes off. If a timer goes off, minissf will call the
 * associated callback function with a pointer to the timer object as
 * the function argument. The user can design a derived class of this
 * class to carry meaningful user data so that when the timer goes
 * off, the callback function will be able to extract the data.
