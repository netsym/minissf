We modified BRITE topology generator to create the queuing model. By default, one can configure the model by modifying 'default.conf' and the queuing model is created in the file 'model.quenet'. One can specify a different configuration file or a different output file by supplying the names of the files in command line as the first and second argument, respectively. Once can also specify the random seed used to generate the network topology in the third command line argument. If it's not specified, the generator sets a seed using the current time (so each time it runs, a different topology is created).

The link bandwidth is translated into the branching probabilities in proportionality. The link delays are used directly as the delays of the connection between the queues. All queues use the same servic time, which is 1 second.
