// CHEAT SHEET:
// * The mapping structure is arranged as follows:
//   1) oc has a unique identifier (called outport number)
//   2) oc maintains a list of outports, DEQUE(MapOutport*), one for each target timeline 
//      (including itself if wired so)
//   3) oc->outports[timeline] points MapOutport, which has:
//      a) a pointer to stargate (if the source and target timelines are not the same); 
//         the stargate is used for timeline (or LP) scheduling purposes
//      b) a pointer to inport (MapInport), if it's on the same machine (maybe belonging
//         to different universe than the source timeline's.
//   4) MapInport is itself a linked list, there's one node per mapped inchannel at the 
//      same timeline
//   5) the stargate is used to represent the link between different timelines
//
// * The delays are arranged as follows:
//   oc->channel_delay (channel delay)
//   oc->outports[timeline]->min_delay (min map_delay among all that mapped 
//     to the same target timeline)
//   oc->outports[timeline]->inport->extra_delay, or
//   oc->outports[timeline]->stargate->inports[oc->portno]->extra_delay 
//     (linked list and sorted incrementally; it's the EXTRA delay after the 
//      previous node)
//  oc->outports[timeline]->stargate->min_delay is the min delay for all mapping from 
//    the source timeline to the target timeline

// this data structure represents a mapping originating from an
// outchannel at the sending timeline; there are as many outports as
// the target timelines
class MapOutport {

  Stargate* stargate; // if not null, this is the stargate between the timelines
